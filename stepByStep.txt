Create/activate a clean venv, then install requirements.txt;
the orchestrator expects the libraries wired up in collect_data.py:24-83.
Collect demo data with python collect_data.py --limit 30 --skip-selenium;
add --skip-selenium if Chrome or a display isn’t available. 
Selenium runs headless by default (scrapers/selenium_scraper.py:24-137) but still needs Google Chrome/Chromium plus network access for webdriver-manager.
After the scrape you’ll have fresh artifacts in data/raw/ (per-method CSV + network JSON) and data/processed/combined_dataset.csv,
which power the downstream report and ML scripts.
Demo Flow

Show the optimization pipeline end-to-end by running python generate_report.py (see generate_report.py:13-185)
open reports/optimization_report.pdf as a visual anchor during the talk.
Highlight the clustering experiment with python notebooks/kmeans_lab.py --clusters 4 --test-size 0.1;
results land in reports/kmeans_holdout_comparison.csv for quick comparison.

For the networking segment, run ./network/network_lab.sh monitor --duration 45 (network/network_lab.sh:22-143).
It calls tcpdump, nload, and the bandwidth sampler, so install those system tools and expect sudo prompts;
keep a chart PNG from network/logs/ ready in case live capture isn’t practical.
Optional slide support lives in reports/presentation_outline.md;
use it to script which assets to show when.

Presentation Tips

Pre-run every step, keep the generated CSV/PDF/PNG files handy, and cache a Selenium run so you can fall back to --skip-selenium
on stage without breaking the narrative.

If you need live notebooks, start Jupyter ahead of time and load notebooks/ml_analysis.ipynb / network_analysis.ipynb so kernels are warm.
Bring up firewall hardening quickly by citing ./network/network_lab.sh firewall (network/network_lab.sh:145-164) but avoid enabling it mid-demo unless rehearsed.
Next steps: 1) Dry-run the entire flow on the presentation machine to confirm drivers and CLI tools; 2) Stage the generated artifacts in the order you plan to reference them.
