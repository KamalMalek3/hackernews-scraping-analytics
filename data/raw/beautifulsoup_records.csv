45653143,Language Support for Marginalia Search,https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_126_multilingual/,55,6,Bogdanp,mariusor,"Off topic, but would there be a way to integrate marginalia with a specific website? Similarly to how people use google search for their forums or how HN uses algolia?I'm asking this as one of my projects is a link aggregator similar to old reddit (and HN to some extent) and I would like to be able to present to users a search box, but without having to implement document indexing and search. (I assume ad principio that the website is already aligned ethically and technologically with what Marginalia stands for :D)reply"
45640838,AWS multiple services outage in us-east-1,https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status?ts=20251020,1922,1889,kondro,time0ut,"Interesting day. I've been on an incident bridge since 3AM. Our systems have mostly recovered now with a few back office stragglers fighting for compute.The biggest miss on our side is that, although we designed a multi-region capable application, we could not run the failover process because our security org migrated us to Identity Center and only put it in us-east-1, hard locking the entire company out of the AWS control plane. By the time we'd gotten the root credentials out of the vault, things were coming back up.Good reminder that you are only as strong as your weakest link.reply"
45652859,Practical Scheme,https://practical-scheme.net/index.html#docs,29,18,ufko_org,zippyman55,"My funny Scheme story.  My work place was using it in production, 1999. A ton of code was written by a VERY SMART (and famous) person and of course it worked.  He delivered it under pressure, ahead of schedule and it just worked.  Ok, but my frustration was that we could not find anyone to support the decoders. So, I could have 300 resumes, and zero would reference scheme.
So, there I was one Sunday, a church greeter, greeting people before church on a Sunday.  And a fellow greeter brought up software, and I somewhat went off on Scheme as to how difficult it was to find interview candidates for the system.
Then, I turn around to greet the next person, and he had a Fricken Scheme Polo Shirt with a prominent Lambda.  I am not sure if he heard me.reply"
45653350,Show HN: I'm rewriting a web server written in Rust for speed and ease of use,https://ferron.sh/,10,3,dorianniemiec,earthnail,"Reach out to the guys at Kamal. They wrote their own reverse proxy because they thought Traefik was too complex, but they might be super happy about yours if Ferron is more powerful yet easy to configure because it might solve more of Kamal’s problems.Not affiliated with Kamal at all, just an idea.reply"
45632429,A laser pointer at 2B FPS [video],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4TdHrMi6do,404,73,thunderbong,estimator7292,"Tl:dw for how this works:He scans one line at a time with a mirror into a photomultiplier tube which can detect single photon events. This is captured continually at 2MSample/s (2 billion times per second: 2B FPS) with an oscilloscope and a clever hack.The laser is actually pulsing at 30KHz, and the oscilloscope capture is synchronized to the laser pulse.So we consider each 30KHz pulse a single event in a single pixel (even though the mirror is rotating continuously). So he runs the experiment 30,000 times per second, each one recording a single pixel at 2B FPS for a few microseconds. Each pixel-sized video is then tiled into a cohesive imagereply"
45617948,Show HN: I'm making a detective game built on Wikipedia,https://detective.wiki/,87,16,jasonsmiles,alex-moon,"This is beautifully designed and engaging and potentially a fun way to learn things! Amazing work.Some things you could add to make it stickier:1. Have a natural end where you ""win"" - possibly I just didn't hit this, it's the kind of game I'd play in bed in the morning as long as the play time was similar to Wordle and the other NYT games.2. Have facts show up when you get something right! Could literally just be the opening sentence from the article and a link to the article. This extra context stimulates curiosity - I'd love to be able to have ""Space physics? That doesn't sound like a real thing..."" and then have the hat guy pop up and go, ""You cracked it chief. Space Physics is the study of high atmosphere plasmas.""EDIT: for comparison, have a look at Metazooa -https://metazooa.com/- which did this very well.reply"
45584680,Bare Metal (The Emacs Essay),https://waxbanks.wordpress.com/2025/08/01/bare-metal-the-emacs-essay/,26,2,hpaone,billfruit,"While I still use emacs, I find that that despite the ""batteries included"" narrative about emacs, the things which are not included are causes of major frustration.Such essential functionality like grep-find and LSP servers which is required for out of the box auto complete are not bundled with emacs. Most modern IDEs/editors have these functionality baked in.If you install emacs for windows you find that grep-find doesn't work, because it depends on support from environment. A full text search should be built into the editor.reply"

45644328,BERT is just a single text diffusion step,https://nathan.rs/posts/roberta-diffusion/,393,94,nathan-barry,jaaustin,"To my knowledge this connection was first noted in 2021 inhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03006(page 5). We wanted to do text diffusion where you’d corrupt words to semantically similar words (like “quick brown fox” -> “speedy black dog”) but kept finding that masking was easier for the model to uncover. Historically this goes back even further tohttps://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09324, which made a generative MLM without framing it in diffusion math.reply"
45578080,When Compiler Optimizations Hurt Performance,https://nemanjatrifunovic.substack.com/p/when-compiler-optimizations-hurt,40,8,rbanffy,president_zippy,"If you wanna really see this at work on a whole other extreme, try compiling code for an N64 game. It's no surprise that optimizations for modern-day x86_64 and Arm64 processors with a lot of cache would not generalize well to a MIPS CPU with a cache that must be manipulated at the software layer and abysmal RDRAM latency, but the exact mechanics of it are interesting.KazeEmmanuar did a great job analyzing exactly this so we don't have to!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca1hHC2EctYreply"

On oral tradition and what is lost,https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=71545,9,3,n2j3,ofalkaed,"The oral tradition is not lost, it just evolved to suit the times; urban myths and creepy pasta just have a lot more relevance. Literacy created the written tradition, moved writing past being just a medium for storage and transmission and moved the word beyond the limitations of speech. What really killed the oral tradition (in the sense TFA means) is technology, the ability to reproduce without error and the idea of ""correctness,"" the old myths ceased to evolve so new ones took their place.reply"
45571423,My trick for getting consistent classification from LLMs,https://verdik.substack.com/p/how-to-get-consistent-classification,191,38,frenchmajesty,minimaxir,"There is a flaw with the base problem: each tweet only has one label, while a tweet is often about many different things and can't be delinated so cleanly. Here's an alternate approach that both allows for multiple labels and lower marginal costs (albeit higher initial cost) for each tweet classified.1. Curate a large representative subsample of tweets.2. Feed all of them to an LLM in a single call with the prompt along the lines of ""generateNunique labels and their descriptions for the tweets provided"". This bounds the problem space.3. For each tweet, feed them to a LLM along with the prompt ""Here are labels and their corresponding descriptions: classify this tweet with up toXof those labels"". This creates a synthetic dataset for training.4. Encode each tweet as a vector as normal.5. Then train a bespoke small model (e.g. a MLP) using tweet embeddings as input to create a multilabel classification model, where the model predicts the probability for each label that it is the correct one.The small MLP will be super fast and cost effectively nothing above what it takes to create the embedding. It saves time/cost from performing a vector search or even maintaining a live vector database.reply"
45647166,Claude Code on the web,https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-on-the-web,465,286,adocomplete,mmaunder,"We were heavy users of Claude Code ($70K+ spend per year) and have almost completely switched to codex CLI. I'm doing massive lifts with it on software that would never before have been feasible for me personally, or any team I've ever run. I'll use Claude Code maybe once every two weeks as a second set of eyes to inspect code and document a bug, with mixed success. But my experience has been that initially Claude Code was amazing and a ""just take my frikkin money"" product. Then Codex overtook CC and is much better at longer runs on hard problems. I've seen Claude Code literally just give up on a hard problem and tell me to buy something off the shelf. Whereas Codex's ability to profoundly increase the capabilities of a software org is a secret that's slowly getting out.I don't have any relationship with any AI company, and honestly I was rooting for Anthropic, but Codex CLI is just way way better.Also Codex CLI is cheaper than Claude Code.I think Anthropic are going to have to somehow leapfrog OpenAI to regain the position they were in around June of this year. But right now they're being handed their hat.reply"
