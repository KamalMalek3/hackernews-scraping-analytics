While a new CPU alone isn’t a thrilling update, it’s important that they do these regularly so consumers looking to buy aren’t forced to buy a 3 year old product with no idea when a refresh will come. I’ve been in this situation many times with Apple and it has been very frustrating. I’m glad they are back on a yearly refresh schedule.I think the issue stems from too many people making their living off reviews that require something exciting to get views. When updates are more evolution than revolution, it makes for a more boring article/video. I always worry that these types of responses will lead Apple to do silly things, like leaving old chips out there too long, or adding pointless features just so there is something new to talk about.reply",beautifulsoup

45733329,The AirPods Pro 3 flight problem,https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/the-airpods-pro-3-flight-problem,426,236,andrem,el_benhameen,"I have this happen outside of flights. Cupping your finger over the ANC mic is enough to trigger it.The new tips (that’s my guess, at least) also transmit vibrations into your ears much more than the old tips or third party memory foam tips. This results in a popping noise when walking or moving around, and a horrible thumping sound when running with them in. I think the latter is partially caused by the “reduce loud noises” feature incorrectly identifying vibrations from heel strikes as loud noise.I’m glad I’m apparently not the only one experiencing these issues. I hope they’re software fixable. I filed a bug report, but radio silence on that, of course. I would sing the praises of the second gen AirPods Pro to anyone who would listen, but the 3rd gen have been a huge disappointment. I had to buy a different set of headphones for running, whereas the second gen were my daily drivers.

45692116,Apple will phase out Rosetta 2 in macOS 28,https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment,160,154,summarity,0x0,"I'm guessing they don't want to maintain and build and test x86_64 versions of all the macos libraries like Appkit and UIKit (including large changes like liquid glass) when they are no longer shipping x86_64 macOS versions. Which is not entirely unreasonable as I'm sure it takes a lot of effort to keep the whole ui library stack working properly on multiple archs.Perhaps that's what they're hinting about with the note about a ""subset of Rosetta"". So maybe there is hope that the core x86_64 binary translator will stick around for things like VM and emulation of generic (linux? wine?) binaries, but they don't want to maintain a whole x86_64 macOS userspace going forward.Space savings from not shipping fat binaries for everything will probably also be not insignificant.

It's almost always old stuff that pre-dates Let's Encrypt (and presumably just nobody ever added HTTPS). The news site which stopped updating in 2007, the blog somebody last posted to in 2011, that sort of thing.I think it's important to emphasise that although Tim's toy hypermedia system (the ""World Wide Web"") didn't come with baked in security, ordinary users have never really understood that. Itseemsto them as thoughhttp://foo.example/must be guaranteed to be foo.example, just making that true by upgrading to HTTPS iswayeasier than somehow teaching billions of people that it wasn't true and then what they ought to do about that.I am reminded of the UK's APP scams. ""Authorized Push Payment"" was a situation where ordinary people think they're paying say, ""Big Law Firm"" but actually a scammer persuaded them to give money to an account they control because historically the UK's payment systems didn't care about names, so to it a payment to ""Big Law Firm"" acct #123456789 is the same as a payment to ""Jane Smith"" acct #123456789 even though you'd never get a bank to open you an account in the name of ""Big Law Firm"" without documents the scammer doesn't have. To fix this, today's UK payment systems treat the name as a required match not merely for your records, so when you say ""Big Law Firm"" and try to pay Jane's account because you've been scammed, the software says ""Wrong, are you being defrauded?"" and so you're safe 'cos you have no reason to fill out ""Jane Smith"" as that's not who you're intending to give money to.Wecouldhave tried to teach all the tens of millions of UK residents that the name was ignored and so they need other safeguards, but that's not practical.

This was pretty normal but what the engineer had done was rotate them at every level so that if a phase was dropped you could count the lights and quickly see from a distance that the power wasn't right. 4 lights was good, 3 meant you dropped a phase, and so on.

I feel like there is an unstated assumption that people in pharma R&D are idiots and haven’t thought of this stuff.Pharma companies care very much about off target effects.  Molecules get screened against tox targets, and a bad tox readout can be a death sentence for an entire program.  And you need to look at the toxicity of major metabolites too.One of the major value propositions of non small molecule modalities like biologics is specificity, and alternative metabolism pathways; no need to worry about the CYPs.Another thing they fail to account for is volume of distribution.  Does it matter if it hits some receptor only expressed in microglia if it can’t cross the blood brain barrier?Also the reason why off targets for a lot of FDA approved drugs are unknown is because they were approved in the steampunk industrial era.To me this whole article reads like an advertisement for a screening assay.reply",beautifulsoup
45734620,The decline of deviance,https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-decline-of-deviance,182,154,zdw,martchat,"I believe there is some merit in the fact that everything is overanalyzed now. Every new trend, fashion, or viral phenomenon is analyzed and commoditized so quickly that it kills its originality. Movies are generated, not directed (Netflix). Music lacks character — where are the crazy, drunken stars from the ’70s, ’80s, and ’90s?I also agree that there may be some connection with the use of mobile phones, which has actually made personal contact more difficult. Previously, if you wanted to discuss something with your neighbor or an old acquaintance, you had to call them and talk. Now it’s often just a chat. People are less aggressive and less willing to take risks.It reminds me of an excellent Stanisław Lem sci-fi novel, Return from the Stars, where an astronaut returning from a mission finds that people on Earth have neutralized themselves from all aggressive impulses, and he is perceived as a wild and dangerous “prehistoric” man.Another factor could also be that populations are growing older, which means less risky behavior and fewer “youth” crimes.On the other hand, perhaps the norm to which we should compare the 20th century is the Middle Ages, when for hundreds of years everyone lived in essentially the same way.reply",beautifulsoup

We were in despair that my child's life was at risk each day we waited because of insurance incompetence.ChatGPT literally guided me through the whole external appeal process, who to contact outside of normal channels to ask for help / apply pressure, researched questions I had, helped with wording on the appeals, and yes, helped keep me pushing forward at some of the darkest moments when I was grasping for anything, however small, to help keep the pressure up on the insurance company.I didn't follow everything it suggested blindly. Definitely decided a few times to make decisions that differed from its advice partially or completely, and I sometimes ran suggested next steps by several close friends/family to make sure I wasn't missing something obvious. But the ideas/path ChatGPT suggested, the chasing down different scenarios to rule in/out them, and coaching me through this is what ultimately got movement on our case.10 days post denial, I was able to get the procedure approved from these efforts.21 days post denial and 7 days after the decision was reversed, we lucked into a surgery slot that opened up and my child got their life saving surgery. They have recovered and is in the best health of the past 18 months.This maybe isn't leveling the playing field, at least not entirely.

I’ve been in this situation many times with Apple and it has been very frustrating. I’m glad they are back on a yearly refresh schedule.
I think the issue stems from too many people making their living off reviews that require something exciting to get views.

The new tips (that’s my guess, at least) also transmit vibrations into your ears much more than the old tips or third party memory foam tips. This results in a popping noise when walking or moving around, and a horrible thumping sound when running with them in. I think the latter is partially caused by the “reduce loud noises” feature incorrectly identifying vibrations from heel strikes as loud noise.

Perhaps that's what they're hinting about with the note about a ""subset of Rosetta"". So maybe there is hope that the core x86_64 binary translator will stick around for things like VM and emulation of generic (linux? wine?) binaries, but they don't want to maintain a whole x86_64 macOS userspace going forward.

I am reminded of the UK's APP scams. ""Authorized Push Payment"" was a situation where ordinary people think they're paying say, ""Big Law Firm"" but actually a scammer persuaded them to give money to an account they control because historically the UK's payment systems didn't care about names, so to it a payment to ""Big Law Firm"" acct #123456789 is the same as a payment to ""Jane Smith"" acct #123456789 even though you'd never get a bank to open you an account in the name of ""Big Law Firm"" without documents the scammer doesn't have. To fix this, today's UK payment systems treat the name as a required match not merely for your records, so when you say ""Big Law Firm"" and try to pay Jane's account because you've been scammed, the software says ""Wrong, are you being defrauded?"" and so you're safe 'cos you have no reason to fill out ""Jane Smith"" as that's not who you're intending to give money to.
We <i>could</i> have tried to teach all the tens of millions of UK residents that the name was ignored and so they need other safeguards, but that's not practical. Upgrading payment systems to check the name was difficult but possible.",api

I feel like there is an unstated assumption that people in pharma R&D are idiots and haven’t thought of this stuff.
Pharma companies care very much about off target effects.  Molecules get screened against tox targets, and a bad tox readout can be a death sentence for an entire program.  And you need to look at the toxicity of major metabolites too.
One of the major value propositions of non small molecule modalities like biologics is specificity, and alternative metabolism pathways; no need to worry about the CYPs.
Another thing they fail to account for is volume of distribution.  Does it matter if it hits some receptor only expressed in microglia if it can’t cross the blood brain barrier?
Also the reason why off targets for a lot of FDA approved drugs are unknown is because they were approved in the steampunk industrial era.

I also agree that there may be some connection with the use of mobile phones, which has actually made personal contact more difficult. Previously, if you wanted to discuss something with your neighbor or an old acquaintance, you had to call them and talk. Now it’s often just a chat. People are less aggressive and less willing to take risks.
It reminds me of an excellent Stanisław Lem sci-fi novel, Return from the Stars, where an astronaut returning from a mission finds that people on Earth have neutralized themselves from all aggressive impulses, and he is perceived as a wild and dangerous “prehistoric” man.
Another factor could also be that populations are growing older, which means less risky behavior and fewer “youth” crimes.
